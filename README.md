Javadoc Generator is an extension to VSCode that wraps the commandline javadoc compiler. To use just open
any .java file and run the generator. The generator will then scan the rest of the project and generate a javadoc for the project.

## Usage
The simplest way to generate a Javadoc for your project is to JDK that comes with Javadoc-Generator. You can preform this command
by <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and then selecting "Javadoc Generator: Built In Generator".

If you would prefer to use the Javadoc that you have installed on your computer you can use the "Javadoc Generator: System Generator". This generator will use the Javadoc located in the JDK referenced in your JAVA_HOME. You can preform this command
by <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and then selecting "Javadoc Generator: System Generator".
